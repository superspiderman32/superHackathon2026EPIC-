# Sisyphus

"One must imagine Sisyphys happy"

A fitness tracking app inspired by the myth of Sisyphus. Log your lifts, watch your progress, and keep pushing the boulder up the mountain.

> To change the world, one must start with himself. Sisyphus was condemned to push a boulder up a mountain, again and again, forever. Yet in that endless repetition lies a choice: to give in, or to find meaning in the climb. **Sisuphys** is for those who choose the climb. Every rep, every set, every day you show up is a step up the mountain. There is no finish line, only the path. Start with yourself. Build the discipline. Push the boulder for a better tommorow.

## Features

- **Home** – Sisyphus imagery that reflects your consistency (slow, pushing, or fast based on workouts in the last 7 days), a consistency grid (“The path up the mountain”), motivational quotes, and streak milestones
- **Tracking** – Log exercises with date, weight, reps, and sets. Data is stored locally with AsyncStorage
- **Progress** – Line charts for weight, volume, or estimated 1RM; filter by 7 days, 30 days, or all time; PR badge when your latest session is a personal record
